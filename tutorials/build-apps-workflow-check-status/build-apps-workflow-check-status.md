# Check Status of Process from SAP Build App
<!-- description --> After triggering a process, you can check the status of that process by calling SAP Build Process Automation APIs from your SAP Build app.

## Prerequisites
- You created the Sales Order Trigger application, as described in [Create SAP Build App to Trigger Workflow](build-apps-workflow-trigger).

## You will learn
- How to store the process ID
- How to call an API to get information about your process instance
- How to create and update local on-device storage

## Intro
In addition to triggering a workflow, you can call other APIs to get information about the status of the workflow, the tasks within a workflow, and a whole lot more.

You can see all the APIs you can call related to SAP Build Process Automation in the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPProcessAutomation/all). Select the API you are interested in, and then click **View the API Reference**.

---

### Create local storage for process information
1. Open the **Sales Order Trigger** app you created in the previous tutorial.
   
2. Go to the **Data** tab.

3. Under **On-device storage**, click **Create Data Entity**.
    
    ![On-device storage](ondevice-new.png)
    
    Call the storage `Workflows`, and click **Add**.

4. To the Workflows entity, add the following fields (go to the bottom of the page):

    | Field Name    | Type    |
    | --- | --- |
    | **processID**    | _Text_    |
    | **status**    | _Text_    |
    | **dateTriggered**    | _Text_    |

    Click **Save** (upper right).

    ![Create fields](ondevice-fields.png)




### Store process ID
1. Go back to the UI canvas of the **Create Sales Order** page.

2. Click the **Get Approval** button, and open its logic canvas.

    You should already see **Create record** and **Toast** flow functions from the previous tutorial.

3. Drag a second **Create record** flow function right after the first one and before the **Toast** flow function.

    Reconnect the flow functions like the following:

    ![New flow function](store-id-flow-function.png)

    >**IMPORTANT:** If a flow function has 2 outputs, use the top one.

    >Every flow function can define different outputs depending on the result of the flow function. Many flow functions -- including **Create record** -- have one output for success (top) and one output for an error (bottom).

4. Click the new **Create record**, and set the following:

    - For **Resource name**, select **Workflows**.

    - For **Record**, click the **Custom object**, and enter the following for each of the following fields:

        | Field         | Value                                                                              |
        | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | **processID**     | Select the formula binding and use: <div></div>```outputs["Create record"].response.id```     |
        | **status**        | Select the formula binding and use:<div></div> ```outputs["Create record"].response.status``` |
        | **dateTriggered** | Select the formula binding and use:<div></div> ```NOW()```                
        
    Click **Save**, and then **Save** again in the upper right.                    





### Create UI for page to display process info
1. Click on the **Create Sales Order** page link.
    
    ![Open pages](page-open.png)
    
    This opens the pages areas.

    Click **Add New Page**, call the new page `Workflow Status`, and click **OK**. 

2. Change the title component text (**Content** property) to `Workflow Status`.

3. Remove the text component.  

4. Add 2 containers, a button, and 2 text components to the page so that the hierarchy of components looks like the **Tree** view below.

    ![Page components](page-components.png)

5. Click the outside container, go to the **Style** tab and select the style we created in the previous tutorial, **Layout Form Container**.

    ![Container style](page-container-style.png)

    >This is the style we created for forms when we created the list of sales order fields on the **Create Sales Order** page.


6. Select the inside container, and in the **Layout** tab, make the following changes:

    - Layout to horizontal
    - Align components to middle

    ![Container align](page-container-align.png)

    The page should now look like this:

    ![Page layout](page-layouts.png)

7. Select the button, and make the following changes:

    - Set the label to `Status`
    - In the **Layout** tab, change the width to **Fit content**.

    Click **Save** (upper right).

The page should look like this:

![Page final](page-final.png)



### Create navigation
1. Click the **Navigation** tab.

2. Click the **Empty Page** page in the navigation menu area. 

    On the right, change the name of the **Tab name** to `Create Sales Order`.

    ![Navigation](navigation.png)

3. Click **Add item**.

    This should automatically add the **Workflow Status** page to the menu, with the same name for the tab name.

    >If not, change the **Tab name** and **Page** to `Workflow Status`.

4. Click **Save** (upper right).




### Create data variable and binding
We now need a data variable to hold the list of workflows that we triggered, so we can bind the data to our UI.

1. Go back to the UI canvas, and open the **Variables** area.
    
    Create a data variable from the **Workflows** data resource.
    
    ![Create variable](data-variable.png)

    Open the logic canvas, and remove the **Delay** flow function.

    ![Remove delay](data-no-delay.png)

2. Click **View** to return to the UI canvas.

3. In the tree view (bottom right), select the inner-most container, **Container 2**.

    In the **Properties** pane, select **Repeat with** and then choose **Data and Variables > Data Variables > Workflows1**, and then click **Save**.

    ![Alt text](data-repeat.png)

    You should now see 4 rows, each with **Status** button and text fields.

    ![Workflows repeat](WorkflowsRepeat.png)

    >**Repeat with:** You will see 4 duplicates of any component that has a binding for **Repeat with**, just to show you there is a binding.
    >
    >If you want to change something with the bindings, only the first (original) components will be selectable.

4. Bind the text fields.

    Click the **Process ID** text field (first one), and for the **Content** binding, select **Data item in repeat > current > processId**, and click **Save**.

    Click the **Status** text field (second one), and for the **Content** binding, select **Data item in repeat > current > status**, and click **Save**.

5. Click **Save** (upper right).

Rerun your app (**Launch > Open Preview Portal > Open Web Preview**), enter fields for the sales order, and click **Submit** to trigger the workflow.

![Trigger workflow](launch-toast.png)

Click the navigation to open the **Workflow Status** page, and you should be able to see the same process ID and its last status, **Running**.

![Navigate to status](data-navigate.png)

![Status running](data-rerun.png)




### Create data resource for status API
In the last step we saved the process ID and status, but the status could have changed in the meantime. So we want to be able to click **Status** and get the latest status.

1. Open the **Data** tab.

2. Click **Create Data Entity > SAP BTP Destination REST API Integration**.

3. On the **Base** panel, enter the following:

    | Field                | Value                                         |
    | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | Data resource name   | `Workflow Information`                             |
    | BTP destination name | `sap-process-destination` (or the destination you created, if you created your own) |

    Under **Resource schema**, click **Add New** and add a field of type _Text_ and with the name `ProcessID`.

4. Click the **create** panel.

    Then enable the create action with the toggle button.

    ![Enable create](create.png)

    <br>

    ![Create](data-resource-create.png)

5. For **Relative path and query**, click the binding **X** (next to the name of the destination), then select **Formula > Create Formula**.

    Use the following for the formula:

    ```JavaScript
    "/" +  query.record.processId
    ``` 

    It should now look like this:

    ![Resource path](data-resource-path.png)

    Click **Save** twice.

6. Change the **Request method** to **GET** (from **POST**).

7. Click **Save Data Resource** (bottom right).

8. Click **Save** (upper right).

Now you can test it if you have an ID of a process instance in SAP Build Process Automation.

>You can get the instance ID by going to the Monitor tab (starting from the SAP Build lobby), and on the left clicking **Monitor > Process and Workflow Instances**.

>Then click on your latest running process. On the right, you can click the copy button next to the **Instance ID** field.

>![Get instance ID](process-id-get.png)

With the instance ID, open the **Workflow Information** data resource again, go to the **create** action, then open the **Test** tab, enter a process instance ID for **ProcessID**, and click **Run Test**. 

![Test connection](test-connection.png)

You should get information about the process, including the process ID, start time, and status.

>You could suspend a process briefly, and then rerun the status API and see that it is suspended. You can then simply resume the process.
>
>![Test status connection](test-connection2.png)





### Create logic to retrieve status
1. Close the **Data** tab.
   
2. In the **Workflow Status** page, click the **Status** button (in the first row), and open the logic canvas for it.

3. Create a logic flow as shown in the following image.
    
    >Always use the top outputs for flow functions with more than one output. 

    ![Logic flow](status-flow.png)

    > **What's going on?**
    >
    >The set of flow functions does the following:
    >
    >1. **Create record:** Retrieves the status of a specific workflow.
    >
    >2. **If condition:** Checks if the status is different from what is recorded in the local on-device storage.
    >
    >3. **Update record:** If the status is different, updates the status in your local storage.
    >
    >4. **Get record collection:** Retrieves the updated list of processes from your local storage.
    >
    >5. **Set data variableCreate record:** Updates the data variable with the data from the API call, which updates the UI.

4. For the **Create record** flow function:

    - **Resource name:** Set to **Workflow Information**. 
    - **Record:** Click **Custom object**, and bind the **ProcessID** field to **Data item in repeat > current > processId**. 

5. For the **If** flow function, bind the **Condition** field to the following formula:

    ```JavaScript
    repeated.current.status != outputs["Create record"].response.status
    ```

6. For the **Update record** flow function:

    - **Resource name:** Set to **Workflows**. 
    - **ID:** Bind to **Data item in repeat > current > id**.
    - **Record:** Click on **Custom object**, and then change the binding for **status** to the following formula:
        ```JavaScript
        outputs["Create record"].response.status
        ```  

7. For the **Get record collection** flow function, just change the **Resource name** to **Workflows**.

    So that the processes are listed with the newest ones on top, click **Ordering**, and then bind to **List of values**. Add the sort property **dateTriggered** and set the sort direction to **desc**. 
    
    Click **Save**. 

8.  For the **Set data variable** flow function:
   
    - **Data variable name:** Set to **Workflows1**.
    - **Record collection:** Bind to **Output value of another node > Get record collection**, click **Collection of records**, and then click **Save**.

9.  Click **Save** (upper right).







### Run app
Run the app again (it should refresh on its own), and click the navigation to go to **Workflow Status**. You should see something like this, with ***Running*** status.

![Status running](data-rerun.png)

Go to SAP Build Process Automation, and just suspend the process.

![Suspend](rerun-suspend.png)

Then go back to your app and click **Status** for the process. The status should change to ***Suspended***.
