# Create a CAP Service with BAS Productivity Tools
<!-- description --> Create a SAP Cloud Application Programming model (CAP) service using the productivity tools in SAP Business Application Studio.
 
 
## Prerequisites
- You have created a trial account, as described in [Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- You have installed SAP Business Application Studio on your trial subaccount, as described in [Set Up SAP Business Application Studio for App Development in the Trial Environment](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-lcap-onboarding-trial.html).
- You have installed SAP Build Apps on your trial subaccount.
  

## You will learn
- How to build a CAP service with low-code tools
- How to create roles to enable authorization for your data entities
- How to deploy your CAP service to SAP BTP


## Intro
You will quickly build a Risk Management service with 2 entities: Risks and Mitigations. Each risk can have 0 or 1 mitigations, while mitigations can be assigned to multiple (or no) risks.

Another key feature is the creation of roles, one for viewer of the data and one for manager, meaning a person who can update the data. The role, exposed in SAP BTP as a role collection, can be assigned to a user once the service is deployed.

>You must set up your SAP BTP tenant with SAP HANA Cloud and SAP Build Apps – your deployed CAP service and SAP Build app must be on the same tenant. For this tutorial, we will assume you are using a trial account.

>You can use SAP Business Application Studio on any tenant, and when it comes time to deploy, deploy the service on the tenant with your SAP HANA Cloud and SAP Build Apps. 



### Open SAP Business Application Studio


[OPTION BEGIN [Use SAP Build Lobby]]
These steps open SAP Business Application Studio using SAP Build's lobby. You must have installed one of the SAP Build tools in order to open the SAP Build lobby.

1. Open the your subaccount, making sure **Instances and Subscriptions** on the left-side menu is selected.

[OPTION END]


### Create data model
1. In the storyboard, click the plus sign ( **+** ) above **Data Models**.

    ![New data model](4-create-data-model.jpg)

    This will display the data model canvas, with a new data entity called `Entity1`. You will now change the name and add the fields.

    Click the **Show Details** icon to open the editor.

    ![Alt text](4-create-data-model2.jpg)

2. In the editor, change the name of the entity to `Risks` (save by clicking the checkmark ☑️) and add the following fields:

    | Property name    | Property Type |  Max Length |
    | -------- | ------- | -------- | 
    | title  | string    | 100 | 
    | prio | string     | 5 | 
    | descr    | string    | 100 |

    >If you are working on trial, you will likely have only one choice for each.

    Click **Apply**.

The deployment will take about 5 minutes to finish. When complete, you will get the URL to your service, though you will not have permissions to view it.

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Command Palette]]
You should use the Task Explorer for deployment. The following instructions describe another, more manual way to do deployment.

1. Log into Cloud Foundry on your trial account by pressing **Control-Shift-P**.

    ![Command palette](8-deploy-login.jpg)

    Type in `CF: Log`, and then select **CF: Login to Cloud Foundry**.

    ![Login command](8-deploy-login2.jpg)

    Enter your Cloud Foundry endpoint, and your username and password for SAP BTP trial, and click **Sign-in**.

    >If you are working on trial, you will likely have only one choice for each.

    Click **Apply**.

3. Go back to the **Home** page, and click **Deploy > Deploy**.

    The deployment will take about 5 minutes to finish. When complete, you will get the URL to your service, though you will not have permissions to view it.

    ![Deployment](8-deploy-login6.jpg)
   
[OPTION END]

### Check service

1. In your trial account, on the left-side menu, click **Cloud Foundry > Spaces**. You likely will have only one space, called **dev**.

    Click the space, and you will now see your application.

    ![Check app](9-check.jpg)

    Click on the link `RickManagement-srv`, and you will see a link. Click on it.

    ![Service start](9-check2.jpg)

    You will get a page with information about your service, with a link to the service (`service/RiskManagement`).

    >You will not see anything yet since you are not authorized.

2. You will need some information about your service to create a destination so that it can be accessed by other applications, like SAP Build Apps.

    Go back to the previous page, and on left click **Service Bindings**, and then click `RiskManagement-uaa`.

    ![Service bindings](9-check4.jpg)

    On the right you will see a service key, and by clicking **View** you will get the client ID, and secret and other information for this service so that you can create a destination.
